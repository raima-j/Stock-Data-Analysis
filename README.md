# Stock-Data-Analysis
As a project in the Internship Program offered by Edureka, I have created a Data Science project on Stock Data analysis using various libraries of Python.
I have taken 4 companies and read the historical stock data for each using YFinance. 
Various functionalities such as finding the trends, creating a chart of up or downtrends of each stock, finding the moving average and calculating the daily returns have been conducted in this project.
